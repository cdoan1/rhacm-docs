= Welcome to Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes documentation. This contributing doc is for external users only. See the following information to contribute to the docs.

[#What-branch-am-I-on]
== What branch am I on

You are currently viewing the _staging_ branch of the documentation for the upcoming release. If you need an update that is exclusive to a previous release, please open an issue and propose that change. Previous releases are updated weekly.

[#How-do-I-submit-a-change]
== How do I submit a change

Because most changes need to be reviewed by development, doc, and QE, it is best to open an issue and let the team make the changes when they are discussed in the issue. You can create a PR if your change is small and requires no debate. You must fork the project and create your own branch. 

Note: Most PRs outside of a typo fix will require an issue.

[#How-is-my-issue-handled]
== How is my issue handled

This issue goes into the _new_ issues column on our ZenHub board and from there will be assigned to the correct writer. This is our open, doc-only board. Internal issues between development and doc are in the team's backlog and treated the same.

Once the change from your issue is accepted, reviewed, and merged into the staging docs for that release, will will let you know in the issue comments and you can close the issue.
